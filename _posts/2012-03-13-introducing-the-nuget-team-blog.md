For the last few months, the NuGet team has been considering starting a proper, official blog. **This is that blog**.

How do we plan to use this blog? Here are a few ways we know we'll use it (and I'm sure we'll think of others as we go along):

*   Announcing new releases
*   Announcing upcoming breaking or very impactful changes
*   Pointing out particuarly important discussions on our CodePlex or GitHub sites

Feel free to leave us a comment, letting us know what else you'd like to see here.
