The Preview Features page under Tools > Options > Environment has a new look! We introduced the Preview Features page so that you can easily find these capabilities and be able to control their enablement. The new layout provides more information and an opportunity to give feedback on the features. While these features are in development, you can disable any of these features if you run into issues.  We also encourage you to provide feedback on the capabilities or any issues you find. Some features you may find on this page includes ones in early development that affect existing functionality, ones that are still evolving, and ones that are experiments that are meant to inform future development. As we continue to iterate on these features, the list of preview features will fluctuate for each Visual Studio release as some features get added into the product and others are cut. You can learn more about the preview features available in each release in the release notes. <img class="wp-image-226040 aligncenter" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/08/word-image.png" />
