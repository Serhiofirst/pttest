Recently there have been customer reports of hangs in Visual Studio while installing or updating NuGet packages. It could be related to [this issue][1], if you have ReSharper 8.1 EAP installed.

The solution is to update ReSharper to one of the stable versions such as ReSharper 8.1. If it doesnâ€™t solve the issue for you, please report it to us through [http://nuget.codeplex.com.][2]
