In September, we shared [Visual Studio 2019 for Mac v8.3][1] with you – this was our biggest release yet for .NET developers working on a Mac. Today, we’d like to invite you to take part in a new community challenge in which you can interact directly with our team to improve Visual Studio for Mac, explore some great looking ASP.NET Core samples, and earn prizes! 
# Taking the ASP.NET Core Challenge Are you ready to jump in? There are just three simple steps to enter: 

[Download the Visual Studio for Mac 8.3 release][2] or [update to it from within the IDE][3] using the Stable channel in the Updater. Now, create or modify an ASP.NET Core site with a web UI using Visual Studio for Mac; you can use the samples from the control libraries mentioned below, or build your own. We only ask that you try our new HTML/CSHTML, CSS, or JavaScript/TypeScript editors. Finally, send us a Tweet of the UI that you build, using the [@VisualStudioMac][4] handle on Twitter along with the hashtags #vs4macChallenge #sweepstakes. Include a screen shot of your running app and an example of the source code you used, running in Visual Studio for Mac! We’ll reply with a survey you can take to share your experience. The survey will also allow you to share your contact information with us if you’d like to be entered for a chance to get swag. 
# Swag! To thank you for your time submitting and filling out our follow-up survey, we have some fun swag giveaways for you! Each submission is entered into a random drawing for 1 of: 

*   **3 grand prizes**: A product license from GrapeCity, Syncfusion, or Progress. Or,
*   **100 first prizes: **A $15.00 voucher for the [.NET Foundation Store][5], to purchase a shirt or stickers. To be eligible, you’ll need to share your email address with us in the survey mentioned earlier. For more details on eligibility, please read the 

[Official Rules][6] for this sweepstakes. 
# ASP.NET Core Samples to help you out To give you some interesting new samples to explore in this challenge, 3 great ASP.NET Core control libraries for you to check out. Each of them has been a great help pulling together some Mac-based instructions to help you get started: 

*   [GrapeCity ComponentOne][7]
*   [Syncfusion Essential Studio for ASP.NET Core][8]
*   [Progress Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core][9] If you have other favorite libraries you prefer to use, that’s great! Just let us know what you used as part of your contest submission. 

# Go forth and code! This challenge starts today, November 5

<sup>th</sup> and goes until November 19<sup>th</sup>, and we’ll share out the end results by November 22<sup>nd</sup>.  As you work with Visual Studio for Mac and build out your app, feel free chat with us on Twitter via [@VisualStudioMac][10]. Now, go have fun and code!
