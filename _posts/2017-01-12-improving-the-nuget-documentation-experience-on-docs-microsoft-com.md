In late 2016, we started on the journey of improving the docs experience for NuGet with the [revamped docs experience][1]. Continuing that journey, today we are announcing the move to [docs.microsoft.com/nuget][2]. Given how NuGet has grown to become an integral part of the Visual Studio and .NET ecosystems, this move furthers the integration by providing a seamless experience to navigate documentation across .NET, Visual Studio and NuGet.

This move also brings several improvements such as:

*   Responsive design supporting multiple form-factors such as mobile devices, tablets, and PCs.
*   Adding side-notes for articles
*   Adding comments as well as subscribing to them
*   Viewing estimated reading time and understanding the freshness of the content 

## Will my existing references to documentation break?

Existing references should continue to work. We have updated the old docs with permanent redirects which will redirect you to the new page. If you find a broken reference, please [open an issue on our GitHub repo][3] and we'll work to get it fixed.

## How can I contribute?

Every page that allows contribution has an “Edit” button at the top right which navigates to the md file. Feel free to make changes and submit a PR from your branch. The NuGet team will review the changes and work with you to get it merged.

If you would like to raise a request for new docs or changes to existing docs, feel free to [open a new issue][3].

## We want to hear your feedback!

We want NuGet to meet the evolving needs of our community. If you would like to share your pain points, and your current or future needs, hit us up at <feedback@nuget.org>. You can also leave a comment below, and as always, if you run into any issues or have an idea, [open an issue on GitHub][4].
