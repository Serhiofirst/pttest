Last month, we launched [a preview of the revamped Nuget docs experience][1]. We made a number of improvements:

1.  New quick-starts for creating and consuming packages.
2.  End to end guides for new platforms such as .NET Standard and UWP.
3.  A simpler and more intuitive organization of topics.
4.  Left pane of contents serves as an index and allows you to glance at all topics.
5.  Cross-references with links to recommended reading, related topics and reference docs.
6.  A modern look and feel to the docs site.

We would like to thank you for trying out the preview and giving us valuable feedback. We have incorporated your feedback and ironed out some wrinkles we found along the way. Today, we are going live with the new experience on [docs.nuget.org][2].

## Will my existing references to documentation break?

Existing references should still work. We have updated the old docs with permanent redirects which will redirect you to the new page. If you find a broken reference, please [open an issue on our GitHub repo][3] and we'll work to get it fixed.

## How can I contribute?

Every page that allows contribution has an obvious “Edit in Github” link at the top. This link will you take you to the md file. Feel free to make changes and create a PR from your branch. The NuGet team will review the change and work with you to get it merged.

If you would like to raise a request for new docs or changes to existing docs, feel free to [open a new issue][3].

## What's next?

Over the next few weeks, we will continue to make more improvements to the docs with respect to content and organization. In addition, we are considering starting our docs migration into docs.microsoft.com in the coming months. Since NuGet is an integral part of the .NET Ecosystem, this move will make it easier to find and navigate our documentation. Moreover, we’ll have a consistent way to get feedback and enable contributions to docs from our users.

## We want to hear your feedback!

We want NuGet to meet the evolving needs of our community. If you would like to share your pain points and your current and future needs, use the [calendly link][4] to set up a quick 15-30 min call with us. If you would like to send us an email instead, hit us up at <feedback@nuget.org>.

You can also leave a comment below, and as always, if you run into any issues or have an idea, [open an issue on GitHub][3].
