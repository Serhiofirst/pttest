### Be More Productive with Visual Studio Container Tools Developers creating serverless solutions using Azure Functions (v2) can now add Docker container support to their C# projects. Among other benefits, this makes Azure Functions much more portable. Furthermore, the Container Tools enhance productivity by easily containerizing Azure Functions in a Linux container. To try it out, right-click the project name in Solution Explorer and select 

**Add > Docker Support**. We didn’t stop there! First, the tools add a Dockerfile to the project and automatically builds the Docker image. Next, you can ensure your code works as expected with the added the ability to debug Azure Functions running inside the container. Make sure the debug target is set to **Docker** to enable this feature. Moreover, you can set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your Azure Functions.

### Productivity Improvements in C++ On the C++ side, we’ve made a variety of productivity improvements including semantic colorization and on-by-default IntelliCode. Next, we've added support for parallel builds in MSBuild-based Linux projects that leverage the native WSL experience.  Finally, there are new C++ Core Guideline rules. You can learn more about what’s new on the 

[C++ Team Blog.][1] We frequently release in-depth blog posts delving into these features throughout the week. 
### Rapidly Iterate on your UIs with the Public Preview of XAML Hot Reload for Xamarin.Forms In July, we announced the private preview of XAML Hot Reload for Xamarin.Forms in Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2019 for Mac. XAML Hot Reload enables you to quickly make changes to your XAML UI and see them reflected without requiring another build and deploy. Notably, this feature requires no setup.  Start debugging, change your XAML, and hit Save to go live. Thanks to the amazing feedback from the private preview, we were able to iterate quickly on the tool.  Consequently, we are excited to launch our public preview as part of this release! Start using it today by enabling it in 

**Tools > Options > Xamarin > Hot Reload**. Learn more in our blog about [XAML Hot Reload for Xamarin.Forms][2] and how to move off the private preview.

### Browser Selection for ASP.NET Core Projects in Visual Studio 2019 for Mac Also available today is Visual Studio 2019 for Mac version 8.3 Preview 2. As part of our continual focus on making the .NET Core experience better on the Mac, we’ve made it easier to launch your ASP.NET Core project in browsers that aren’t your default macOS browser. For example, you can now select a particular browser to be used for run or debug via the configuration selector when working with ASP.NET Core web projects in Visual Studio 2019 for Mac.
