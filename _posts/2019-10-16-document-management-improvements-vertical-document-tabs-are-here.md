Vertical tabs give you the option to better utilize horizontal screen space and at the same time gives more vertical space for your code. It lets you see more of your open document tabs and gives an intuitive and flexible way of ordering them. 
## Enabling Vertical Document Tabs

<img class="alignnone wp-image-226784" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/10/word-image-5.png" alt="Vertical Tabs in Tools > Options" width="743" height="508" /> To try out vertical tabs, enable Vertical document tab layout feature by going to **Tools > Options > Environment > Preview Features**. Once the feature is enabled you will be able to see additional settings for vertical tabs under **Tools > Options > Environment > Tabs and Windows **and to easily change tab layouts between the three orientations (left, right, and top) with the document tab’s right-click context menu. <img class="alignnone wp-image-226785" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/10/word-image-7.gif" alt="Two ways to change tab layout" width="1280" height="711" /> 
## What’s New in the Vertical Layout While designing for the vertical layout, we took the opportunity to improve on today’s document management experience. 

### Easily Change Layouts Easily switch your tabs to the left, to the right, and back to the top as needed with the right-click context menu.

### Sorting Take control of how your tabs will be opened. In addition to the default alphabetical sort, we’ve added the ability to have your tabs open via most recently opened as well. While alphabetical sort has a fixed order, most recently opened will allow you to rearrange the order of your tabs after opening them.

### Vertical and Horizontal Document Groups Vertical and horizontal document groups are also easily manageable with just one vertical tab well.

## What’s Next?

### Vertical Tabs This is the first peek at the work we are doing in bringing vertical tabs to Visual Studio. For next steps, we will be monitoring all the feedback to identify any key missing features or enhancements needed for the feature. 

### Document Management The Vertical Document Tabs feature is just one step in a larger effort to improve the document management experience in Visual Studio. We will be looking at other features that will help boost productivity like 

[grouping][1], adding more [sort types][2], and improving today’s horizontal tab experience. For a full list of suggestions we are tracking, take a look at this [Developer Community ticket][3].
