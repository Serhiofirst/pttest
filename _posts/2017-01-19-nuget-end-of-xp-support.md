At NuGet, we are constantly improving our security. One of the steps we are taking is to move our HTTPS end points to meet industry standards for algorithms and protocols. This means that connecting to nuget.org services from machines that donâ€™t support modern cipher algorithms will no longer be supported (such as TLS 1.0 support in Windows XP). [Windows XP reached end of OS support on April 8, 2014][1], and does not meet this minimum requirement. Therefore, **we plan to end NuGet support for Windows XP on April 8, 2017**.

After support is discontinued, you will no longer be able to connect to nuget.org services from any Windows XP machines. Examples of scenarios that will no longer work include browsing the nuget.org web site, pushing packages using Nuget.exe or using the NuGet package manager inside Visual Studio. To continue using nuget.org services, you need to move to an OS that supports more modern cipher algorithms (such as Windows 10).

## We want to hear your feedback!
