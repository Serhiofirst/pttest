Over the last couple of years, we've had the chance to meet with many individuals who both use and contribute to NuGet. One of the questions that has come up on more than one occasion pertains to how decisions get made for NuGet, especially decisions around which features are included in NuGet releases. This is an understandable question, especially since the NuGet core team consists of Microsoft employees.

In order to provide more transparency around both the decision making structure and the different project contribution levels, we've published our [governance document][1] on [docs.nuget.org][2]. Please take a look and let us know your thoughts.
