With the [NuGet 1.8 release][1], we found a breaking change that caused NuGet to fail on Windows XP machines. Earlier today, we released a hotfix to NuGet 1.8 that addresses this.

We apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused. If you have further issues, please report them on [CodePlex][2].

For more information, there is a [CodePlex discussion thread][3] for this issue, which resulted in a [work item][4] to fix the regression.
